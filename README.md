The Modern Periodic Table project is a simple console application built without the use of graphics. It is developed using the C programming language for the purpose of storing name, symbol, atomic number, atomic weight, and some important properties as well as to display them as per requirement of the user.

ALGORITHM 
Step 1 − START. 
Step 2 − Declare all the functions. 
Step 3 − Declare global variables ,i.e., strings Name, Symbol , double Weight. 
Step 4 − Hardcode the Name , symbol and weight. 
Step 5 − Initializing and defining all the function using loops , and conditional statements. 
Step 6 − Take the input by the user as per by either name , symbol or weight. 
Step 7 − If the input is acceptable then it'll show the output containing all the information about the element. 
Step 8 − STOP.

Exploration of element Information: Another main function of this project is to explore or to display the stored information. You can search an element by using any of the following method-

By Atomic Name of Element By Atomic Symbol of Element By Atomic Number of Element By Atomic Weight of Element.
